Create a futuristic React-based frontend for a Health Records Management System (HRMS) with the following:

🚀 OVERVIEW:
- Two login roles: Doctor and Patient
- After login, each user sees their own role-based dashboard
- Biometric login placeholder (fingerprint scan + PIN) for Patient login
- Styled using TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui (glassmorphism, neumorphism, modern transitions)

🔐 LOGIN FLOW:
- Patient login via Email + Fingerprint Scan (simulate with animation and button click)
- Doctor login via License ID + Password
- Role-based routing using React Router ("/patient/*", "/doctor/*")

📋 CORE SCREENS:

1. Patient Registration Page  
   - First Name, Last Name, DOB, Email, Phone  
   - Validations: regex + tooltips  

2. Doctor Registration Page  
   - License ID, Full Name, Specialization (dropdown)  
   - Admin-only Verified checkbox  

3. Doctor Dashboard  
   - Left sidebar: Profile, View Assigned Patients  
   - Main card area:  
     ▸ List of all assigned patients  
     ▸ Searchable/filterable table  
     ▸ “View History” button for each patient → shows structured summary (insulin, glucose, treatments)  
     ▸ Notifications for new report uploads  

4. Patient Dashboard  
   - Left sidebar: Profile, Upload Reports  
   - Main card area:  
     ▸ Table of previously uploaded reports (disease name, date, status)  
     ▸ Button to upload new medical report  
     ▸ Timeline or chart view of extracted attributes (e.g. insulin values over time)  

5. Medical Report Upload  
   - Select Disease → Add attributes (e.g. insulin, glucose), Measurement Date  
   - Upload file (PDF/Image, max 10MB)  
   - Use dynamic fields and componentized inputs  

6. Consent Management  
   - Patient grants READ/WRITE/SHARE access to doctors  
   - Date picker and doctor selector  
   - Display all active consents  

7. Fingerprint Scan Page  
   - Biometric scan button (simulate FHE with loading + match success)  
   - Placeholder component with animation  
   - PIN fallback input  

🧱 TECH STACK:
- React + Vite
- TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui
- React Router DOM for role-based routes
- React Hook Form + Zod for validation
- Axios with mock APIs (no real backend needed now)
- Lucide-react for icons

📊 UX DESIGN:
- Futuristic, minimal, glass-style UI
- Animated transitions on login, dashboard card load, and report uploads
- Data cards with pills, chips, and clean font hierarchy
- Dashboards built with Grid + Card components

📦 OUTPUT:
- Pages: Landing, DoctorLogin, PatientLogin, PatientDashboard, DoctorDashboard
- Components: FormCard, ReportUploader, HistoryCard, FingerprintButton, TimelineChart, ConsentModal
- Data: Mocked report uploads, doctor-patient assignments in local state

🧠 BONUS:
- All dashboards are mobile-responsive
- Show toast notifications on actions (upload, scan, consent)
- Use localStorage for temporary login state
